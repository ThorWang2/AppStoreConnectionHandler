The objective of this class is simple:- To open an app store URL.

Instead of just doing [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:someURL]; use this class to catch errors that could occur due to unsupported URL's, network unavailability, etc without actually taking user out of the application.

Run the app and refer the DemoViewController to see how this apps helps you toggle between opening an invalid URL and an app store URL, starting with invalid URL.
